## Fatima & Hanna
### Installation:
- download repo
- install pipenv
- pipenv shell
- pipenv install
- flask run - run app
- pytest - run tests
- exit - exit pipenv environment

### Idea:
- A user can create short links: localhost/link/users_choice
- A user can add as many links as they like
- Short links have to be unique
- A user can update the short link or delete the url 
- There is a table which displays all the created links
